Challenge 1: Subsets and Supersets  
  Concept:   Checking if one set is fully contained within another.
  Objective:   Work with subsets and supersets.
  Task:  
- Create two sets: `set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and `set_b = {2, 3, 4}`.
- Check if `set_b` is a subset of `set_a` and print the result.
- Check if `set_a` is a superset of `set_b` and print the result.

  Example Output:  
```
True
True
```
